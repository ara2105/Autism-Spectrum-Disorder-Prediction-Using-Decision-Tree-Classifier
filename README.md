# ðŸ§  Autism Prediction using Tree-Based Models

A machine learning project to predict autism using Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning.

## Features

- Binary classification for autism prediction  
- Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost models  
- Hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV  
- SMOTE for class balancing  
- Performance evaluation and model comparison  

## Dataset

This project uses a preprocessed dataset for autism screening which includes:  
- Clinical and behavioral attributes  
- Binary target variable indicating ASD  
- Feature preprocessing and encoding steps  

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Run the notebook**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Autism_Prediction_using_Decision_Tree_Classifier.ipynb
   ```
